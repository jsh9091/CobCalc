# CobCalc
CobCalc is a simple calculator program written in COBOL. 

CobCalc was tested with GnuCOBOL 3.1.2.0.  

CobCalc performs basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The program supports numbers as large as having seven digits to the left of the decimal point and two digits to the right of the decimal point. 

To compile CobCalc with GnuCobol: 

1) In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the CobCalc.cob file. 
2) Enter the command: cobc -x CobCalc.cob 
3) The directory should now contain a file name CobCalc without the “.cob” extension. 

To run CobCalc: 
1) In the terminal run the command: ./CobCalc
2) Follow the prompts in the program to enter information as instructed.
